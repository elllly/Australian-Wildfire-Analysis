# Australian Wildfire Analysis

Overview:
---------
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Australian Wildfire Analysis project, which focuses on the analysis and visualization of wildfire data in Australia. The project involves using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Folium, Dash, and Plotly for data analysis, visualization, and building a dynamic dashboard.

Key Features:
--------------
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Analyzed and visualized wildfire data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Folium. Explored patterns, trends, and insights in the data to better understand the dynamics of wildfires in Australia.

- Dynamic Dashboard: Developed a dynamic dashboard with Dash and Plotly to facilitate user interactions. The dashboard provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring wildfire data, allowing users to customize visualizations and gain insights in real-time.

Dependencies:
--------------
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Folium
- Dash
- Plotly
